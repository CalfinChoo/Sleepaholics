  - DB is initialized whenever app is run
  - Created login/register routes
  - Login/register works and adds to db
  - Created homepage with create game and join game features
  - Create game creates new game with random room code and it creates a new row in DB (password optional)
  - Joining a game requires correct code and password, and adds one to the player count (nothing happens when you leave however)
  - Basic template and routes are done
